            AI is flashy, outstanding and mindblowing. <br />
            With a few questions you can feel empowered to give the first step
            to accomplish a dreaded task or learn a challenging but desired
            hability that usually finds a way to escape prioritization on your
            weekly review. <br />
            However it can also be tricky if you get and create a house of
            cards. You can get entranced by its allure getting to the conclusion
            that whatever you do is now inconsequential. <br />
            So what it is the difference between empowerment and a house of
            cards? Discernment. <br />
            There is a chinese proverb that says: <br />
            <blockquote>
                "If the wrong person uses the right means, the right means work
                in the wrong way"<br />
                <cite>&mdash; Chinese proverb</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>What I find fascinating:</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Accesibility:</strong> It is easy to use, 100%
                    anyone can use it, you dont even have to know how to write
                    or even speak, it could understand half questions, bad
                    pronunciations and bear repetition that a school teacher
                    would die to have. So the conclusion is that to better use
                    the tool, you have to understand what you are asking for it
                    to do. Yo uneed to understand if not deeply at least the
                    basic components and interplay they have. It will only
                    listen to your You cannot ask it for your recipe you need to
                    practice and experiment to have a way it can give you the
                    desired outcome.

                    <strong>Instant Mood Boost:</strong> Feeling down? Have a
                    donut. It's scientifically proven* that donuts can turn a
                    frown upside down. (*Not actually proven, but we all know
                    it's true.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Endless Creativity:</strong> Donut shops are
                    constantly coming up with new and exciting flavors. From
                    maple bacon to matcha green tea, the possibilities are
                    endless. It's like a delicious adventure every time you
                    visit.
